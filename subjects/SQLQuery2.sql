('Literature', 'Literature is the artistic expression of human thought, experience, and imagination through written or spoken word. It encompasses various genres, including poetry, drama, fiction, and non-fiction. Literature reflects the culture, history, and values of the societies in which it is created. Through character, plot, setting, and theme, authors explore universal questions about love, identity, justice, and existence. It serves as both a mirror and a lamp — showing us the world as it is and as it could be. Literature preserves languages and traditions and fosters empathy by allowing readers to step into lives different from their own. Great literary works often stand the test of time, influencing generations of readers and writers. It can be deeply personal or profoundly political, entertaining or revolutionary. Literary criticism and theory help readers analyze texts beyond surface meaning. Overall, literature enriches human understanding and fuels imagination across time and space.', 4),
('Physics', 'Physics is the branch of science that studies the fundamental laws governing the universe. It explores how matter and energy interact through forces like gravity, electromagnetism, and nuclear interactions. From the motion of planets to the behavior of atoms, physics seeks to describe nature with precision. It is divided into areas such as classical mechanics, quantum physics, thermodynamics, and relativity. Physics has led to transformative technologies including electricity, nuclear power, telecommunications, and medical imaging. Mathematical models and experiments are key tools physicists use to test and refine theories. Physics is foundational to many other sciences and engineering disciplines. Concepts like time, space, and energy in physics help us understand everything from black holes to the Big Bang. It also challenges our intuition by revealing counterintuitive truths, like time dilation or quantum entanglement. Ultimately, physics attempts to answer the most fundamental questions about the nature of reality.', 3),
('Mathematics', 'Mathematics is the study of quantity, structure, space, and change through abstract reasoning and logical thinking. It involves numbers, symbols, patterns, and formulas to model and understand real-world and theoretical problems. Mathematics is often considered the "language of science" because it underpins disciplines like physics, economics, computer science, and engineering. It includes branches such as algebra, geometry, calculus, statistics, and number theory. The foundation of math lies in axioms and proofs, ensuring precision and consistency. Mathematicians use logic to explore infinite structures and solve problems ranging from everyday budgeting to cosmic computations. It is both a tool and an art — useful in practical applications and beautiful in pure form. Mathematics evolves through discovery and abstraction, often ahead of its time in application. It fosters critical thinking and problem-solving skills across all domains. Whether measuring the height of a mountain or encrypting data, mathematics makes modern life possible.', 4),
('Philosophy ', 'Philosophy is the intellectual discipline that investigates fundamental questions about existence, knowledge, values, reason, and consciousness. It is concerned with "why" and "how" things are, rather than just "what" they are. Philosophers seek truth through rational inquiry, debate, and systematic thought. It covers branches like metaphysics (reality), epistemology (knowledge), ethics (morality), logic (reasoning), and aesthetics (beauty). Unlike empirical sciences, philosophy does not rely solely on observation but uses argumentation and reasoning. It forms the foundation of many disciplines including science, law, politics, and theology. Ancient philosophers like Plato and Aristotle shaped early ideas about government, education, and virtue. Modern philosophy continues to evolve, tackling new issues such as artificial intelligence, climate ethics, and existential risks. Philosophy teaches critical thinking, encourages open-mindedness, and challenges assumptions. At its core, it invites us to examine how we live and what it means to live well.', 2),
('Biology', 'Biology is the scientific study of life and living organisms. It investigates how organisms grow, reproduce, evolve, and interact with their environment. Biology spans from microscopic life forms like bacteria to complex systems like ecosystems and human bodies. It is divided into subfields such as genetics, physiology, ecology, evolution, and molecular biology. Biologists seek to understand cellular processes, hereditary information, and species development over time. Biology helps explain the diversity of life and the mechanisms that sustain it. It is critical to fields like medicine, agriculture, biotechnology, and environmental science. Biological research has led to lifesaving vaccines, disease treatments, and sustainable food solutions. Biology emphasizes observation, experimentation, and the scientific method. Ultimately, biology provides insight into the complexity, beauty, and interconnectedness of life on Earth.', 1),
('History', 'History is the study of past human events, cultures, and civilizations. It seeks to understand how societies have developed over time and how past events shape the present and future. Historians analyze written documents, artifacts, architecture, and oral traditions to reconstruct narratives. History is divided into various eras and regions, such as ancient history, medieval history, modern history, and global history. It includes political, social, economic, cultural, and military aspects of human life. Studying history promotes an understanding of cause and effect, continuity and change, and multiple perspectives. It teaches critical thinking, source evaluation, and awareness of bias. Historical knowledge helps prevent the repetition of past mistakes and fosters informed citizenship. Through stories of struggle, triumph, and innovation, history connects us to our ancestors and our identities. Ultimately, history is not just about what happened, but why it matters.', 1)
